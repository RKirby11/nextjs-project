# NextJS Project (Corresponds with Rails API project)

A personal project to practise React and learn the basics of the NextJS framework.

This repository interacts with a Rails API to manage user authentication (using JWT tokens) and database management.

The idea of the project was to create a web app which offers artists a new random word each day to inspire them. It offers the ability to sign up, discover the word of the day, upload (or take) a photo of their resulting art, and save it to review in the future.

As the project is focused on learning it's not complete. Further steps might include email authentication, UI improvements, enabling users to connect with friends and share their work, and stronger error handling and testing.
